# Description
CNum is a numeric library for C written for fun, i.e, it is not intended to be used in any serious nor critical application. It was inspired in [GNU Multiprecision Arithmetic Library](https://gmplib.org/), from where i learned some minor implementation details too. It should implement basic multiprecision operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation, as well as facilities like printing the calculated numbers (in any base between 2 and 16).

In the future, i plan to implement a parser for these basic operations, creating an interactive environment where you can perform these basic calculations without bothering about the library itself.

(More sections as soon as the library has enough content to justify it)
